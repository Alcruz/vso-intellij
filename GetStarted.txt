    * mvn install

Copy Dependencies
=======================
From the command line, go to your Java.IntelliJ/source/TfIntelliJPlugin folder and execute the following two gradle commands:
    * gradlew copyDependencies
optionally copy source files: 
(for now this is experimental as it copies both jar and source jar, need to figure out how to skip actual jars)
    * gradlew copyDependenciesSource
